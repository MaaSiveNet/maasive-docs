#Building an API

The very first step in building a MaaSive.net API is to tell the system what you want your API to look like. We do that with the **API Specification Document** or "API Spec" for short.

##API Specification

The API Spec is a JSON document that tells MaaSive how to build your API. The API spec has several different parts:

- [resources](#/docs/specification/resources)
- [collections](#/docs/specification/collections)
- [conf](#/docs/specification/conf)
- [name](#/docs/specification/name)
- [admins](#/docs/specification/admins)
