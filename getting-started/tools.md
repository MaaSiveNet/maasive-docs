If you haven't interacted directly with a REST API before, you might find it frustrating to test your Requests without a good tool.  The best/easiest tools that we have found for direct interaction with REST APIs is the [Postman - REST Client][2] plugin for Chrome.  Using this tool or one like it will make your life a lot easier.
